HR Analytics with Logistic Regression

Overview
This project dives into the HR dataset from Kaggle, focusing on key features such as satisfaction level, average monthly hours, promotion in the last 5 years, and salary. The logistic regression model is employed to analyze the correlation between these features and employee turnover.

Key Steps
Data Source: Utilized the comprehensive HR dataset from Kaggle, encompassing crucial features.

Data Preprocessing: Created a new DataFrame with relevant features, one-hot encoding the salary variable.

Model Building: Leveraged Logistic Regression to analyze the correlation between selected features and employee turnover.

Training and Prediction: Split the data, trained the model, and made predictions. Achieved an impressive accuracy of 78.04%.
